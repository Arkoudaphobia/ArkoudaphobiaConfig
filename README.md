# Arkoudaphobia Server Config
This repository is a living document of sorts.  What you see here is going to be what you'll get on the server and the changes made here will, through automation I've setup, end up on the server.

Configuration changes and updates for mods are pushed ever two hours starting at 12:00 AM PST.  

For information on how to contribute or request changes see the wiki artical on requesting and making changes located [here](https://github.com/Arkoudaphobia/ArkoudaphobiaConfig/wiki/Requesting-and-making-changes).

To learn more about why I chose GitHub for storing the servers mod and config files at all there's a wiki artical for that as well [here](https://github.com/Arkoudaphobia/ArkoudaphobiaConfig/wiki/Why-GitHub)

Below you'll find an indicator of the status of the most recient configuration push to the server.
